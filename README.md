* explanations of the technologies used
```
I utilized HTML to organize the DOM elements and create a user interface, CSS to style the HTML and make the site responsive, jQuery to access and manipulate elements on the DOM and Javascript.
```

* the approach taken
```
I started by diagraming the board as a single array and listing out the rules of the game. I wrote psudo-code for each of the rules of the game and established all of the variables I would need to access and would need on the interface. I then I then turned the variables into semantic HTML. After creating the HTML, I styled the HTML so that the page would be user friendly and responsive. Finally, I used javascript and jQuery to add game play functionality and logic.

* unsolved problems
```
I need to add a conditional test which only allows the player to play pieces on their side of the board. I also need to change the userSide array's so that each player is given a row.
